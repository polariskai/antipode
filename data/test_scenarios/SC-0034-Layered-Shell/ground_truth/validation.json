    "Add transaction dates and amounts showing structured patterns under reporting thresholds",

    "Specify offshore jurisdictions (e.g., Cayman Islands, BVI) for shell company operations",
    "Add 20-30 transactions with layering (e.g., currency conversion, trade-based) and integration phases",
    "Show transaction flow between entities with logical timing (e.g., 30-60 day intervals)",
