    "Total amount ($99,997.07) is suspiciously close to $100,000 threshold but structuring typically involves multiple transactions under $10,000 (not cumulative total)",
    "4 entities with 8 accounts suggests complex layering rather than simple structuring",
    "Precision to the cent ($99,997.07) indicates deliberate avoidance of round numbers, which is structuring behavior but the total amount is unrealistic",
    "12 transactions across 8 accounts may indicate account layering rather than straightforward structuring"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Adjust total amount to demonstrate multiple $9,999 transactions totaling ~$99,990",
    "Reduce entity count to 1-2 for pure structuring scenario",
    "Simplify to 3-4 accounts with 10-15 small transactions",
    "Add geographic jurisdiction details to show cross-border structuring patterns"
