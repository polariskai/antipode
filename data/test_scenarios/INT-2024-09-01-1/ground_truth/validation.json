    "Integration typology typically requires more complex transaction layers than 12 total transactions",
    "Only 4 entities with 8 accounts may be insufficient for effective money integration",
    "Transaction count (12) appears too low for $88k+ amount without showing proper layering",
    "No evidence of final integration methods (real estate, art purchases, etc.) in transaction details",
    "Lack of geographic diversity in entities/accounts reduces typology realism"
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Add 2-3 more entities to create proper business layering",
    "Include 15-20 transactions with varied timing and amounts",
    "Specify integration methods like property purchases or business investments",
    "Add cross-border transactions to demonstrate geographic complexity",
    "Include shell company structures or charitable donations as integration vehicles"
