    "Mule networks typically require more entities (5 is low for realistic complexity)",
    "15 transactions is insufficient for a layered mule network typology",

  "suggestions": [
    "Add 3-5 more entities to create a more complex network structure",
    "Increase transactions to 30-50 to show proper layering",
    "Specify jurisdictions across multiple countries with different regulatory regimes",
    "Include shell company entities with no legitimate business activity",
    "Add transaction dates showing staggered timing across weeks/months"
